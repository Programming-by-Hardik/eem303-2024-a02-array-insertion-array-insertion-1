# C Programming Assignment: Array Insertion

## Overview
In this assignment, you will be working with arrays in C. The goal is to write a program that can insert elements into an array at the end, the beginning, and at a specified index. This will help you understand basic array manipulations and enhance your problem-solving skills in C programming.

You will be provided with a partially completed code file. Your task is to complete the functions in the code that handle the insertion operations.

## Assignment Tasks

### 1. Insert at the End
- **Task:** Complete the `insertAtEnd` function.
- **Details:** You need to insert a user-specified element at the end of the pre-populated array.

### 2. Insert at the Beginning
- **Task:** Complete the `insertAtBeginning` function.
- **Details:** You need to insert a user-specified element at the beginning of the pre-populated array, shifting all existing elements to the right.

### 3. Insert at a Given Index
- **Task:** Complete the `insertAtIndex` function.
- **Details:** You need to insert a user-specified element at a given index in the array, shifting the elements from that index onward to the right.

## How to Complete the Assignment

1. **Open the provided `.c` file:**
   - This file contains the main program structure and partially completed functions. Your task is to fill in the missing code within the `insertAtEnd`, `insertAtBeginning`, and `insertAtIndex` functions.

2. **Read the comments:**
   - Each function contains comments that guide you on what needs to be done. Follow the instructions carefully to complete the functions.

3. **Test your code:**
   - The code file includes test functions that will be executed to check if your implementation is correct. Run the program and verify that the output matches the expected results.

4. **Run the tests:**
   - To verify the correctness of your implementation, you can run the provided `test.sh` script. This script will compile your code and run test cases to ensure your functions work as expected.

## Running the Tests

1. **Compile your program:**
   - Run the following command in your terminal to compile the program:
     ```bash
     gcc -o array_insert_solution_modular array_insert_solution_modular.c
     ```

2. **Run the test script:**
   - Execute the test script to check your code:
     ```bash
     bash test.sh
     ```
   - The script will report whether each of your functions passed the test cases.

3. **Review the results:**
   - If any tests fail, review your code and make the necessary corrections. Once all tests pass, your assignment is complete.

## Submission
Once youâ€™ve completed and tested your program, commit your changes and push them to the repository. Ensure that your code is correctly formatted and includes any necessary comments explaining your logic.
